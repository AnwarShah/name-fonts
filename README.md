# A Simple script to correctly name fonts file

# Usage
To use the script, clone the repository or copy and paste the script
into your `~/bin` folder. Then navigate to the directory where
fonts are located. Then execute the command to rename them all.

    ~/bin/name_fonts.sh

# Limitation
This script currently only name files adding `.wotf` extension.

# ToDo
Correctly guess the file type and add extension with matching type.
